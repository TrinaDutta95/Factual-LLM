They hope it will safeguard his legacy.\nBilly Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene.\nMillar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s.\nA veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France.\nSmith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe.\nHe picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong.\nHe is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.\n\"Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?\" I wondered.\nSmith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: \"In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.\n\"Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.\n\"So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.\n\"He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.\n\"The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.\"\nMillar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy.\nAnd then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - \"the Caledonian antisyzygy\" on two wheels.\nLang put it thus: \"Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.\"\nBilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: \"Robert was special.\n\"He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.\n\"I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.\n\"I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.\"\nThe sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event.\nThe intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.\n\"He was one of my idols,\" said Smith. \"He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.\n\"I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.\n\"And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.\n\"Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world.\"",

        "doc": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline.\nThe NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday.\nNAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August.\nLighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing.\nLast week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\"\nBut the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself.\n\"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier.\nSince sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.\nCortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",
